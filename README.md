# ETL Pipeline Using Databricks and Apache Spark for Twitter Dataset

## 📚 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for Twitter data using **Databricks** and **Apache Spark**. The goal is to extract raw tweet data, transform it for analysis, and load the cleaned data into a target storage system, leveraging Spark's distributed processing capabilities within the Databricks environment.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Apache Spark** (Structured Streaming, DataFrame API)
- **Databricks** (Collaborative data engineering platform)
- **Python** (PySpark for Spark Jobs)
- **Twitter API / Twitter Dataset** (For data ingestion)
- **Delta Lake** (for reliable data storage, optional)
- **AWS S3 / Azure Blob Storage** (optional for data storage)

---

## 🛠️ Project Architecture
1. **Extract**:
   - Connect to the Twitter API / Load pre-collected Twitter dataset.
   - Ingest raw tweet data into Databricks in batch or streaming mode.

2. **Transform**:
   - Clean and normalize the raw data.
   - Extract fields such as username, tweet text, hashtags, timestamp, location, etc.
   - Handle missing values and apply necessary transformations.

3. **Load**:
   - Store the transformed data into a storage solution (Databricks File System, Delta Lake, or Cloud Storage).
   - Make the data ready for downstream analytics or ML applications.

---

## 🧩 Features
- End-to-end ETL process using PySpark on Databricks.
- Real-time or batch ingestion of Twitter data.
- Data cleaning, transformation, and normalization steps.
- Scalable and fault-tolerant architecture using Spark.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. **Set up Databricks Workspace**  
   Create a cluster with Spark runtime.

2. **Prepare the Dataset**  
   - If using the Twitter API: Set up authentication and streaming/batch collection.
   - If using an existing dataset: Upload the dataset to DBFS or cloud storage.

3. **Develop the ETL Notebook**  
   - Write PySpark code to perform extract, transform, and load steps.
   - Save transformed outputs as Parquet/Delta tables.

4. **Schedule the Pipeline (optional)**  
   - Use Databricks Jobs to schedule the ETL to run at intervals.

## 🏆 Key Learning Outcomes
- Build a real-world ETL pipeline for social media data.
- Work with semi-structured JSON data using Spark.
- Perform transformations using PySpark DataFrame operations.
- Use Databricks for collaborative data engineering tasks.
- Prepare datasets for analytics or machine learning.

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Integrate real-time streaming with Twitter API.
- Automate data quality checks and validation.
- Visualize insights from the cleaned Twitter data.
- Deploy using CI/CD pipelines for ETL automation.
